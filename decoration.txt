The fundamental addition that exc makes to C's grammar is decorations.
Decorations are a sort of "escape" from C code that has no defined semantics.
Instead, modules loaded by exc transform the decorations into regular C code
before it is compiled.

Decorations add ambiguity to the C grammar. Where ambiguous, optional parts of
the decoration are preferred to outer productions (i.e., the same rule used by
all other ambiguities in C)

To support decorations, the C grammar is extended as follows:

punctuator:
    @ /@ @/

decoration-name:
    «any token other than (, ), {, }, [, ], @, /@ or @/»

decoration-open:
    ( decoration-open-cont )

decoration-open-cont:
    «any sequence of tokens with matching ()s»

primary-expression:
    decoration-expression

decoration-expression:
    @ decoration-name decoration-open-opt decoration-sub-expression-opt
    /@ decoration-name decoration-open-opt decoration-sub-expression-opt @/

decoration-sub-expression:
    { expression-opt }
    { block-item-list }

declaration:
    decoration-declaration declaration
    decoration-declaration ;

declaration-specifiers:
    declaration-specifiers decoration-declaration

specifier-qualifier-list:
    specifier-qualifier-list decoration-declaration

decoration-declaration:
    @ decoration-name decoration-open-opt decoration-sub-declaration-specifiers-opt
    /@ decoration-name decoration-open-opt decoration-sub-declaration-specifiers-opt @/

decoration-sub-declaration-specifiers:
    { declaration-specifiers-opt }
