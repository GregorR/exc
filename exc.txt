See decorations.txt for changes to C's syntax.

Builtin decoration stages:

(1) import stage: Parses, reads @import decorators and imports all dependencies.
(2) extension stage: Reads @extension decorators and loads extension modules.
[...] extension modules are run
(+3) header stage: @public, @header, @private handled.
(+4) raw stage: @rem, @raw and @include decorators replaced.


Builtin decorations:

@rem(...)
    decorator declaration or decorator expression as expression statement
    Simply removed (comment).

@raw(...)
    any decoration
    Raw code which is not parsed (but is tokenized). Dumped directly to
    resultant C. In the case of an expression decoration which is not an
    expression statement, is surrounded by parentheses. In the case of an
    operator decoration, the expression and both subexpressions are surrounded
    by parentheses. In the case of a decorator declaration, the terminating
    semicolon is omitted.

@include(...);
    decorator declaration
    Directly generates a #include.

@import(...);
    decorator declaration
    @includes the .h file generated from the imported .exc file, but also
    parses the .exc file for @extension declarations.

@public
    declaration decorator or decorator declaration
    Puts a declaration for the associated declaration or definition in the
    generated .h file, and potentially REMOVES the declaration/definition from
    the .c file. What precisely is added depend on what is declared or defined:
     * decorator declaration:
        If any other decorators are present, all other decorators and comments
        are moved to the header. Otherwise, comments are copied to the header.
     * function-definition:
        A prototype for the function is added to the header.
     * declaration with init-declarator-list, no "extern" or "typedef":
        The declaration is added to the header, prefixed with "extern".
     * other:
        The entire declaration is moved to the header.

    decorator declaration
    The preceding whitespace/comments are added to the generated .h file.

@header
    declaration decorator
    The associated declaration or definition is added to the generated .h file,
    and NOT the generated .c file.

    decorator declaration
    The preceding whitespace/comments and any other decorators are added to the
    generated .h file, and NOT the generated .c file.

@private
    declaration decorator or decorator declaration
    Ignored. For symmetry with @public and @header.
