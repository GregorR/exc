exc is based on C, and is syntactically almost identical to C, with the
following exceptions:

 * First and most obviously, exc supports decorators. See decoration.txt for
   the description of their syntax.

 * exc's scanner does not support digraphs or trigraphs, neither of which were
   ever good features in the first place.

 * exc's scanner requires /* */ comments to have the '/' immediately next to
   the '*', with no intervening '\' and newline.

 * Empty structs and unions (e.g., struct Foo {}) are allowed in exc.

 * Empty translation units (i.e., files empty of all but whitespace) are
   allowed in exc.

 * Old-style (K&R) function definitions are not allowed.

 * C has a rather famous typedef ambiguity. exc does not, and, in fact, cannot
   resolve this ambiguity, as it does not see all sources before parsing. When
   ambiguous, exc prefers a type parsing to a value parsing.
